# Tricon_Sort

"" <i> only comparisons allow sorting , no comparisons , no sorting </i>""

## Points

1) Basic Sorting Algorithm . 

2) Uses Three point , Comparisons

3) Number of Array Elements = Multiple of Three

4) Able to Place Two Big elements on there positions , after each iteration

## Concept

Algorithm has Three major steps :

1) Pull
2) Push
3) Compare

The Pull part involves , pulling elements from the array , to three variables </br>
for comparison . It aslo covers the part of pulling new elements from the array  </br>
when previous comparisons are done .


## How does it Compare

<img src="ScreenShots/Compare Truth Table.jpg" height="400" width="450">

1] truth table
2]unique value creation

## How are the elements Pushed

1] ations based on the unique value created

## Early Exit Feature


## Some thoughts

1] possibility not speed
2] existence of diff ways
